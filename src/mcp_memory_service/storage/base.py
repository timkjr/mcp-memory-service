        Unified memory search with flexible modes and filters.

        This method consolidates all search/retrieve operations into a single flexible interface.
        Supports semantic search, exact matching, time-based filtering, tag filtering, and
        quality-based reranking.

        Args:
            query: Search query string (required for semantic/exact modes, optional for time-only)
            mode: Search mode - "semantic" (default), "exact", or "hybrid"
            time_expr: Natural language time filter (e.g., "last week", "yesterday", "2 days ago")
            after: Return memories created after this ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
            before: Return memories created before this ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
            tags: Filter to memories with any of these tags
            quality_boost: Quality weight for reranking 0.0-1.0 (0.0=pure semantic, 1.0=pure quality)
            limit: Maximum number of results to return (default: 10)
            include_debug: Include debug information in response (default: False)

        Returns:
            Dictionary with:

                - total: int - Number of results
                - query: str - The query used
                - mode: str - The search mode used
                - debug: Dict (if include_debug=True) - Debug information

        Modes:
            - semantic: Vector similarity search (default) - finds conceptually similar content
            - exact: Case-insensitive substring match - finds memories where content contains the query string
            - hybrid: Semantic search with quality-based reranking

        Time Filters:
            - time_expr: Natural language like "yesterday", "last week", "2 days ago", "last month"
            - after/before: Explicit ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD)

        Quality Boost (for semantic/hybrid modes):
            - 0.0: Pure semantic ranking (default)
            - 0.3: 30% quality weight, 70% semantic (recommended for important lookups)
