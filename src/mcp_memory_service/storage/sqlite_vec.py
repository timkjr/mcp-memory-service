    SQLite-vec based memory storage implementation.

    This backend provides local vector similarity search using sqlite-vec

    Composed from focused mixins:
    - BaseMixin: connection, threading, retry, utilities
    - MigrationsMixin: schema setup and migrations
    - EmbeddingsMixin: model initialization and embedding generation
    - StoreMixin: store and store_batch operations
    - RetrieveMixin: retrieve, search, and query operations
    - HybridMixin: BM25 + vector hybrid search
    - DeleteMixin: soft-delete and purge operations
    - MetadataMixin: metadata updates, conflicts, versioning
