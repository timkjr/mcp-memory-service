## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
- Platform-specific requirements:
  - **macOS**: Homebrew Python recommended for SQLite extension support
  - **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools for some dependencies
  - **Linux**: Build essentials package

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-memory-service.git
   cd mcp-memory-service
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python install.py
   ```
   This will automatically detect your platform and install appropriate dependencies.

4. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/verify_environment.py
   ```

5. **Run the service**:
   ```bash
   uv run memory server
   ```

6. **Test with MCP Inspector** (optional):
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run memory server
   ```

### Alternative: Docker Setup

For a containerized environment:
```bash
docker-compose up -d  # For MCP mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.http.yml up -d  # For HTTP API mode
```

## Development Process

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation
- `test/` for test improvements
- `refactor/` for code refactoring

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the coding standards (see below)
- Add/update tests as needed
- Update documentation if applicable
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_server.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=mcp_memory_service tests/
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Use semantic commit messages:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add memory export functionality"
git commit -m "fix: resolve timezone handling in memory search"
git commit -m "docs: update installation guide for Windows"
git commit -m "test: add coverage for storage backends"
```

Format: `<type>: <description>`

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 5. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

Open a PR from your fork to the main repository with:
- Clear title describing the change
- Description of what and why
- Reference to any related issues
- Screenshots/examples if applicable

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8 with these modifications:
  - Line length: 88 characters (Black formatter default)
  - Use double quotes for strings
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all public functions/classes (Google style)

### Code Organization

```python
# Import order
import standard_library
import third_party_libraries
from mcp_memory_service import local_modules

# Type hints
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any

# Async functions
async def process_memory(content: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Process and store memory content.

    Args:
        content: The memory content to process

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing memory metadata
    """
    # Implementation
```

### Error Handling

- Use specific exception types
- Provide helpful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Never silently fail

```python
try:
    result = await storage.store(memory)
except StorageError as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to store memory: {e}")
    raise MemoryServiceError(f"Storage operation failed: {e}") from e
```

## Testing Requirements

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Name test files with `test_` prefix
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies

Example test:
```python
import pytest
from mcp_memory_service.storage import SqliteVecStorage

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_store_memory_success():
    """Test successful memory storage."""
    storage = SqliteVecStorage(":memory:")
    result = await storage.store("test content", tags=["test"])
    assert result is not None
    assert "hash" in result
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Focus on critical paths and edge cases
- Test error handling scenarios
- Include integration tests where appropriate

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public APIs
- Include type hints
- Provide usage examples in docstrings
- Keep comments concise and relevant

### Project Documentation

When adding features or making significant changes:

1. Update README.md if needed
2. Add/update Wiki pages for detailed guides
3. Update CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
4. Update AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md if development workflow changes
